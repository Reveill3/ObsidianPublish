## Highlights
### INVENTING THE STRAIGHT LINE
- There were only fourteen objections, and half of them were variations of two: First, that it was a bad time of year, as in it’s tax time, summertime, back-to-school time, Christmastime, Miller time, Groundhog Day. And second, that they needed to speak to someone else, as in their spouse, their lawyer, their business partner, ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=471))
- **the common objections were nothing more than smoke screens for what was really holding a prospect back, which was a lack of certainty.** ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=482))
- no matter what objection the prospect hit me with, I would never just answer it and ask for the order again. ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=483))
- By itself, in fact, all an answer would do (even a perfect one) is force a prospect to shift to a new objection, because the root problem still hadn’t been addressed. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=485))
- In consequence, after I answered an objection, I would then loop back to the beginning of the sale and make a follow-up presentation that picked up where my initial presentation had left off—with a goal of increasing the prospect’s state of certainty for all three Tens. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=486))
- “When you’re speaking, it’s directed. It’s powerful. Your words have meaning behind them; and the meaning is to create massive certainty in the mind of your prospect as you move him down the straight line, from the open to the close.” ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=564))
- “You see, **with the Straight Line, you need to gather intelligence—and I mean massive intelligence—which goes far beyond trying to figure out whether or not a prospect is financially qualified.** ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=575))
- “When you gather intelligence from a prospect, you’re doing all of the following things: **“First, you’re identifying their needs—and not just their core need but also any secondary needs or ‘problems’ they might have. “Second, you’re identifying any core beliefs they might have that could impact the sale, such as not feeling comfortable working over the phone or with making quick decisions, and also not trusting salespeople in general. “Third, you want to find out about any past experiences they’ve had with similar products, both good and bad, and how they feel about the salespeople they bought them from. “Fourth, you want to identify their values—meaning, what things are most important to them? Are they looking for growth or income, or do they want to set themselves up for retirement, or to give their profits to a certain charity, or a religious institution? It can even be that the prospect is an action junkie and they’re in it for the thrills. “Fifth, you want to identify their financial standards, insofar as what level of wealth and spending ability they need to have to feel good about themselves. “Sixth, where their pain lies—meaning, what’s keeping them up at night? What’s that one single financial worry that sits at the very base of their skull and weighs them down, like an anchor?** ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=577)) [[To increase certainty for a prospect you need to gather intelligence on their needs]]
- “When you’re off the line, you’re looking to (a) continue building on the rapport that you already have, and (b) use that rapport to help you gather the more invasive intelligence, like how liquid the prospect currently is. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=591))
- three basic tenets of the front half of the Straight Line: 1 You must take immediate of control the sale. 2 You must engage in massive intelligence gathering, while you simultaneously build massive rapport with your prospect. 3 You must smoothly transition into a Straight Line presentation, so you can begin the process of building absolute certainty for each of the Three Tens. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=595))
- “**Every word that comes out of your mouth is feeding into one single goal, which is to increase your prospect’s level of certainty to the highest possible level**, as you’re moving him down the straight line towards the close. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=623))
#### Five Core Elements of the Straight Line System
- 1 The prospect must love your product. 2 The prospect must trust and connect with you. 3 The prospect must trust and connect with your company. In essence, as you move your prospect down the straight line, everything you say should be specifically designed to increase your prospect’s level of certainty for at least one of the three elements—with ([Location 697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=697))
- **in the vast majority of cases, you’re going to have to ask for the order at least two or three times before you have any chance of your prospect saying yes.** ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=705))
## New highlights added January 16, 2024 at 5:32 AM
- Looping is a simple yet highly effective objection-handling strategy that allows a salesperson to take each individual objection and use it as an opportunity to further increase a prospect’s level of certainty, without breaking rapport, and then seamlessly transition into a close. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=717))
- In other words, **each objection creates the opportunity to loop; and each loop results in a further increase to a prospect’s level of certainty**; and as each loop is completed, the prospects find themselves that much farther down the line, and that much closer to the close. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=721))
- what separates all these potential buyers from one another is the sum of the individual beliefs they have about buying, about making decisions in general, and about trusting other people, especially those who are trying to sell them things. Together, the sum of all these beliefs, and all the experiences that have contributed to the formation of these beliefs, creates a defined “threshold of certainty” that a prospect must cross over before he or she feels comfortable enough to buy. We call this level of certainty a person’s action threshold, ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=733))
- **a prospect’s action threshold is malleable; it is not set in stone.** ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=742))
- So, for these ultra-tough nuts to crack, we now turn to the fifth core element of the Straight Line System: the pain threshold. You see, at the end of the day, pain is the most powerful motivator of all—causing ([Location 748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=748))
- In essence, **pain creates urgency, which makes it the perfect vehicle for closing these tougher sales.** ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=750))
- THE FIVE CORE ELEMENTS OF THE STRAIGHT LINE SYSTEM 1 The prospect must love your product. 2 The prospect must trust and connect with you. 3 The prospect must trust and connect with your company. 4 Lower the action threshold. 5 Raise the pain threshold. ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=757))
- when you’re moving a prospect down the Straight Line. Essentially, you’re cracking the code to his or her buying combination, and you’re doing it the same way every single time. ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=771))
- there are only five numbers in the combination; that’s it! The first number is a prospect’s level of certainty about your product; the second number is their level of certainty about you; the third number is their level of certainty about your company; the fourth number addresses their action threshold; and the fifth number addresses their pain threshold. ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=773))
- **You need to take immediate control of the sale**. ([Location 785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=785))
### THE FIRST FOUR SECONDS
- FOR BETTER OR WORSE, WE have to accept the fact that, as human beings, we’re basically fear-based creatures. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=797))
- During a phone call with a prospect, you have a bit longer—**you have four seconds to make an impression.** ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=809))
- if you want to be perceived in just the right way: **1 Sharp as a tack 2 Enthusiastic as hell 3 An expert in your field** Those three things absolutely must come across in the first four seconds of a conversation; otherwise, you set yourself up for a major uphill battle. ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=813))
- My point here is that how you are perceived will carry through to every part of the sale, but it starts in the first four seconds. If you screw that up and make a negative first impression, then you basically have no chance of closing the deal. ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=851))
- Today, I have a strong belief in sales as an honorable profession, and I’ll only operate in sales situations where I have an unyielding and passionate belief in the value of the product or service I’m offering to prospects. ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=873))
- the biggest misconception among new salespeople is that they feel like they have to wait a certain amount of time until they can brand themselves as an expert. That’s a load of crap! You need to be “acting as if” from the very start, while you educate yourself as fast possible, to close the knowledge gap. ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=884))
##### Show Them You’re Worth Listening To
- **When you immediately establish these three things, they roll up into one simple fact in the prospect’s mind, namely that you’re a person worth listening to.** ([Location 888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=888))
- someone who’s as sharp as you and enthusiastic as you, and who’s achieved your level of expertise, is going to: 1 Get to the point quickly 2 Not waste the prospect’s time 3 Have a solution to their problem 4 Be an asset to them over the long-term ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=890))
- In addition, once the prospect has come to this positive conclusion about you, their brain will instantly extrapolate your value to its logical end, which is: You can help them achieve their goals. You can help get them what they want in life. ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=896))
- **the Straight Line System is as much about becoming an expert listener as an expert talker**. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=910))
### TONALITY AND BODY LANGUAGE
## New highlights added January 18, 2024 at 2:02 PM
- There is no combination of words that are profound enough and stealthy enough to sneak past the logic center of your prospect’s mind and create an emotional reaction that goes straight to their gut; for it’s there, in your prospect’s gut, where first impressions get formed in fractions of a second, and they’ll guide their decisions until you prove them wrong. So if your words won’t do it, then where do you turn? The answer is simple: your tone of voice. ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=922))
- We call this second modality body language ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=933))
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In terms of percentages, tonality and body language comprise approximately 90 percent of our overall communication</mark>, ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=939))
- **HUMAN COMMUNICATION Tonality—45% + Body Language—45% = 90% Words—10%** ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=948))
- The key here is modulation. You want to lower your voice, and then raise your voice; you want to speed up, and then slow down; you want to make a declarative statement, and then turn it into a question; ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=993))
- But of course, you’re not actually saying those words. They’re registering with the prospect unconsciously, in the form of a gut feeling, which moves them on an emotional level, as opposed to a logical one. You see my point? ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1000))
- I’m talking about something called bottled enthusiasm, which sits just below the surface and literally bubbles over as you speak. It’s about enunciating your words with absolute clarity and stressing your consonants so that your words have intensity to them. ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1006))
- **Just always remember to never stay in any one tonality for too long, or else the prospect will become bored**—or in scientific terms, habituate—and ultimately tune out. To that end, I am constantly using my tonality and body language to insure against that. You see, **tuning out does not happen randomly; it’s based on a conscious equation the prospect is running as to whether or not you’re a person worth listening to.** ([Location 1011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1011))
- When the sales encounter is over the phone, we’ll use our ten core tonalities to move our prospect emotionally, while the words they’re attached to will move the prospect logically; ([Location 1073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1073))
- **you’ll use words to influence your prospect’s conscious mind, and tonality and body language to influence their unconscious mind.** ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1076))
### STATE MANAGEMENT
- In essence, the Straight Line System served as the Great Equalizer, allowing even the most disempowered men and women to completely reinvent themselves and start their lives anew. ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1092))
- In short, future pacing entails running an imaginary movie through your mind where you get to see yourself in the future having already achieved a certain outcome. The result is that you get to experience the positive feelings associated with a future achievement right now, ([Location 1108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1108))
- I would say, **“Act as if you’re a wealthy man, rich already, and you will become rich. Act as if you have unmatched confidence, and people will have confidence in you. Act as if you have all the answers, and the answers will come to you.”** ([Location 1114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1114))
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">When you’re in an empowered state—like “certainty,” for instance—then you’re able to access your internal resources, which then sets you up for massive success.</mark> ([Location 1121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1121))
- As a salesperson—or as any success-oriented person—you must learn how to start triggering the key empowered states; otherwise, you set yourself up for a lifetime of pain. ([Location 1139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1139))
- **there are four key states that you need to learn how to trigger at will within state management. We call them the four Cs: Certainty, clarity, confidence, and courage.** ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1153))
- As the story goes, when I was on my first global speaking tour, I began to find myself in situations where it was crucial for me to be in an empowered state despite the fact that the surrounding environment was often working heavily against me. ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1159))
- NLP’s basic premise is that the human brain functions similarly to a computer and hence can be programmed as such to make near instant changes to certain key behavioral patterns. The only sticking point, however, is that before you can make any changes, you need to know two important things first:  How to write code for the human brain  What type of software to embed the code in ([Location 1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1169))
- According to NLP, the software of the brain is language, and the way you write code is by creating language patterns, which consist of a group of words—as ([Location 1174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1174))
- The basic premise of NLP anchoring is that human beings have the ability to choose how they feel at a particular moment in time, as opposed to it being chosen for them ([Location 1178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1178))
- In other words, human beings, as a species, will all adapt virtually the same physiology when they’re in a happy, positive emotional state. ([Location 1197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1197))
- Let’s say you were in a depressed state right now, and I offered you $50,000 to act happy for the next sixty seconds. Could you do it? Yes, of course you could! It would be as simple as consciously making certain obvious changes to your physiology, ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1210))
- **NLP’s first leap of logic was based on the idea that human beings could proactively manage their emotional state with near 100 percent success by directing their focus and their physiology in a specific way.** ([Location 1226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1226))
### A SUREFIRE FORMULA FOR MANAGING YOUR STATE
- There are five basic steps to NLP anchoring: Step #1: Choose a state ([Location 1285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1285))
- This will always be a conscious decision, based on the circumstances that you’re about to face, not what you’re currently facing. ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1287))
- For the purpose of this exercise, let’s choose a state of absolute certainty, ([Location 1289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1289))
- Step #2: Choose your focus ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1290))
- Step #3: Choose your physiology ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1301))
- This is where you’re going to change your physiology to match the exact physiology of the state that you’re trying to anchor. ([Location 1302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1302))
- Remember, being shy or bashful with your physiology is not going to serve you at this point. Quite simply, this is one of those cases where more is more, not less is more, ([Location 1307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1307))
- Step #4: Intensify your state ([Location 1310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1310))
- This step involves using your five sensory modalities—also known as your five senses—to take the picture you’ve created in your mind’s eye in step two and use your brain to manipulate it in a way that intensifies the feeling of absolute certainty ([Location 1310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1310))
#### PUTTING YOUR BRAIN TO WORK
- As you’re making these various “edits” to this internal movie, notice how the feelings associated with this memory continue to intensify and intensify. ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1351))
- All these little adjustments you make, using the power of your mind, will, in fact, intensify your state even further, which is crucial, because you can only set an anchor when you’re at the absolute pinnacle of a state! ([Location 1360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1360))
- Step #5: Set your anchor ([Location 1362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1362))
- The name of the product I found was BoomBoom. See what this is at www.boomboomenergy.com. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1378))
- After I became a master practitioner in NLP, I spent the next six months trying to set an anchor for myself for a state of certainty ([Location 1387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1387))
- But, to my own shock, when I tried to set an anchor, it didn’t take. No anchor was set. So I tried again, and again, and again. ([Location 1392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1392))
- The necessity of having to be at the absolute peak of a state in order to successfully set an anchor makes this strategy extraordinarily tough to execute. ([Location 1396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1396))
- I mean, to truly-truly do this, with no bullshit or exaggeration—is a major long shot, and most importantly, it’s also prone to massive self-delusion, where people try to talk themselves into having succeeded because they desperately want the benefit. ([Location 1398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1398))
- Well, in the end, what I eventually came to realize was that the only surefire way for me to be truly at that ultra-intense level of absolute certainty that’s required to set a legitimate anchor was to wait until I was actually in that state organically and set my anchor then. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1406))
- **All I had to do was wait until I closed a really big sale, in the real world, which caused me to pop me into a peak state of absolute certainty organically, and then, right then—and I mean right then, in that very instant—when I was basking in the afterglow of closing an awesome sale, and I knew in every cell of my body that I truly was in an organic state of absolute certainty, as opposed to an artificially manufactured imitation, I would bring out my BoomBoom and take a giant whiff up each nostril —boom! boom!**— ([Location 1409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1409))

### ADVANCED TONALITY
##### Ten Core Influencing Tonalities
- in the absence of the right tonality, your ability to move your prospect emotionally is severely limited and your ability to close is also limited accordingly. Remember, it’s your words that move a prospect logically, and it’s your tonality that moves your prospect emotionally. ([Location 1528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1528))
- starting with the simplest of all rules, which states that a salesperson should never address their prospect in an overly formal manner; instead, the salesperson should address the prospect in the way they would respectfully address a friend. ([Location 1534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1534))
- the salesperson should simply say, in a very upbeat tone: “Hi, is John there?” ([Location 1537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1537))
- Now, when I say, “a very upbeat tone,” I’m referring to one of the ten core influencing tonalities, called the “I care” or “I really want to know” tonality. ([Location 1538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1538))
- **like when you say “how are you”—it goes a long way toward establishing instant rapport with someone and establishing yourself as a person who cares and really wants to know how they’re doing.** ([Location 1542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1542))
- This tonality creates an unconscious psychological connection, because we naturally feel closer to people who express a sincere caring for our well-being. ([Location 1544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1544))
- tonality is the secret weapon of influence, because it’s an unspoken language. ([Location 1550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1550))
- second core influencing tonality, which is called phrasing a declarative as a question, and he applies it in the following words: ([Location 1554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1554))
- Now, clearly each of those three thoughts is a declarative statement, not a question. However, by phrasing them as questions, you’ve tapped into the power of three separate human desires simultaneously: 1 To not be perceived as being out of the loop 2 To remember people we’ve met before 3 To appear generally agreeable ([Location 1560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1560))
- Now watch what happens to the punctuation when Bill Peterson phrases those declaratives as questions: “Hi, my name is Bill Peterson? Calling from Acme Travel Company? In Beverly Hills, California? How are you today?” ([Location 1566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1566))
- **This is a tonality you want to use sparingly, but it’s incredibly powerful in gaining agreement with your prospect.** ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1574))
- **What happens in that very instant, when you phrase a regular statement as a question, is that it sends your prospect’s brain into search mode**, ([Location 1578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1578))
- **In this particular instance, the next group of words you’re going to say—aka, your next language pattern, in Straight Line parlance—is going to explain the precise reason why you called the prospect today.** ([Location 1588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1588))
- We call this reason a justifier, inasmuch as it creates a justification for your reaching out to the prospect. ([Location 1591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1591))
- when you use a justifier correctly, it will dramatically increase the compliance rate for whatever request you’re making. ([Location 1593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1593))
- let’s just focus on the justifier itself and the tonality that Bill is going to apply to it—namely, the tonality of mystery and intrigue. ([Location 1595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1595))
- “Now, John, the reason for the call today is that we’ve been reaching out to a select group of homeowners in your area to offer them . . . ,” ([Location 1596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1596))
- **The way you create mystery and intrigue with this tonality is by lowering your voice to just above a whisper and then hanging on the R in the word “reason” for an extra fraction of a second.** ([Location 1600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1600))
- because you lower your voice to just above a whisper, the reason takes on the properties of a secret, creating a sense of urgency and scarcity, ([Location 1602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1602))
- by explaining to the prospect that the car he wants is in short supply, the salesperson increases the likelihood that the prospect will buy the car now, ([Location 1611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1611))
- **you should always try to create at least some degree of urgency right before you ask for the order**, as it will dramatically increase the likelihood of your prospect saying yes. ([Location 1614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1614))
- second type of scarcity tonal scarcity. ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1616))
- third type of scarcity, which is called informational scarcity—meaning, the information itself is in short supply. ([Location 1621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1621))
- First, verbal scarcity is used to convey the logic: “We only have one black-on-black 750iL left, and once it’s gone, it’s going to be three months until our next shipment comes in.”  Second, you add on tonal scarcity by using a power whisper, which greatly intensifies the prospect’s sense of scarcity.  And third, you add on informational scarcity by explaining that even the information itself is in short supply. ([Location 1625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1625))
- In essence, with the tonality of absolute certainty, your voice takes a firmer, more definitive tone, with a power that seems to come right from your solar plexus, ([Location 1638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1638))
- Utter sincerity: This is a calm, smooth, confident, low-pressure tone that implies that what you’re currently saying to the prospect is coming directly from your heart, ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1640))
- 3 **The reasonable man**: ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1645))
- **you don’t just start pitching your prospect an idea, without first saying something along the lines of “If you have sixty seconds, I’d like to share an idea with you. You got a minute?”** ([Location 1648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1648))
- Those last three words—“got a minute?”—are when you apply the reasonable man tone, ([Location 1650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1650))
- for whatever reason—meaning, your prospect hits you with one of the common objections—they still want to think about it. The first question you’re going to ask them, no matter what objection they hit you with, is: “Does the idea make sense to you? Do you like the idea?” ([Location 1667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1667))
- That’s the beginning of a language pattern that will allow you to transition into your first looping pattern, ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1670))
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">So let’s say in response to you asking for the order, your prospect says, “It sounds good. Let me think about it.” Your reply would be: “I hear what you’re saying, but let me ask you a question. Does the idea make sense to you? Do you like the idea?”</mark> ([Location 1671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1671))
- hypothetical, money-aside tone.V The additional words that your prospect hears in this case are “Hypothetically speaking, putting money aside, does the idea make sense to you? ([Location 1675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1675))
- Next, we have the tonality of implied obviousness. ([Location 1679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1679))
- you’re in finance, for example, you might say, “Now, John, you’ll make money with this, but more importantly, what I can do for you over the long term in the way of new issues and arbitrage plays . . .” ([Location 1682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1682))
- This brings us the to last of the ten core influencing tonalities: “I feel your pain” V—which I also refer to, on occasion, as the Bill Clinton tonality, due to his complete and utter mastery of it. ([Location 1685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1685))
- The key to this tonality is that you’re expressing empathy and sympathy, and that you truly feel their pain and deeply care about helping them resolve it. ([Location 1692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1692))
### ADVANCED BODY LANGUAGE
- **The bottom line is that nonverbal communication is ten times more powerful than verbal communication, and it hits you with the force of a cannonball to the gut. **([Location 1715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1715))
- It’s not so much that effective body language will close the deal for you. What I’m saying is ineffective body language will blow the deal for you. ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1719))
- **Either you are being judged as a person who is sharp, on the ball, someone they want to do business with, or you’re being judged as someone they do not want to do business with**, ([Location 1723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1723))
- The bottom line is this: body language is not going to get you the sale, but the wrong body language will destroy the opportunity to make a sale. ([Location 1737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1737))
- remember that getting into a rapport with someone is done primarily through tonality and body language, not your words. In terms of body language, I’ve talked about wrapping your package, but there’s so much more. ([Location 1775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1775))
- **Let’s start with spatial awareness. If you’re a man selling to another man, then you want to do what’s called cornering off—meaning you want to stand at a slight angle to another man, as opposed to directly in front of him.** ([Location 1777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1777))
- It’s almost like letting air out of a balloon when you corner off. You feel an immediate release of pressure. ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1782))
- **For communication with a woman, though, it’s the exact opposite. If you’re a man trying to influence a woman, the woman wants you to stand directly in front of her and keep your hands above waist level, where she can see them.** ([Location 1783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1783))
- Conversely, if you’re a female trying to influence another female, then you definitely want to corner off, just like a man with another man; ([Location 1785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1785))
- People tend to stand a bit closer in Asia, marking about a half-foot difference. ([Location 1791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1791))
- matching means that if someone shakes your hand firmly, then you should shake theirs just as firmly—up to a point. ([Location 1808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1808))
- You’re better off letting them out-squeeze you a bit, while you maintain good, solid eye contact, ([Location 1811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1811))
-<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> if you don’t make eye contact at least 72 percent of the time, people won’t trust you.</mark> There have been detailed studies on this stuff, and 72 percent is the number. ([Location 1812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1812))
- if I had a choice, I’d want my prospect’s arms in an open position versus closed. All things being equal, it does usually mean that someone’s more open to your ideas. But I definitely wouldn’t take it as the ultimate sign. ([Location 1819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1819))
##### Active Listening and the Art of Matching
- Let’s start with something as simple as nodding your head while your prospect is speaking. When you nod your head, it shows that you get what that person is saying; that you’re on the same page. ([Location 1832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1832))
- Then you add an occasional nod, along with a few ahas! and yups! and I got its! ([Location 1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1835))
- The master of this type of body language is President Bill Clinton. ([Location 1839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1839))
- **Matching is an incredibly powerful tool for getting into a rapport with someone, especially when you’re in person and you can match both body language and tonality. But it can also be extremely effective over the phone too, if you focus on matching not just someone’s tonality, but also their rate of speech** ([Location 1848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1848))
- But I am a fan of matching, which means that if your prospect leans back in their seat, then you lean back in your seat too, but you do it slowly, casually, after a five- or ten-second lag. ([Location 1856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1856))
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In the end, it all goes back to likability—meaning that people want to do business with people who are basically like them—not different.</mark> ([Location 1857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1857))
## New highlights added January 19, 2024 at 6:37 AM
- Matching can be a way to calm anyone down, or get them excited about something, or feeling certain about something. You simply enter their world where they are, and then you pace them, you pace them . . . and then you lead them in the direction you want them to go. ([Location 1882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1882))
### THE ART OF PROSPECTING
- “I don’t sell things to people who don’t need them. I leave that to novices, like you.” ([Location 1928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1928))
- Here, we refer to this process as “Straight Line prospecting,” and the primary method by which we do our sifting is through gathering intelligence. ([Location 1939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1939))
- Conversely, when you are in control, the barrage stops. Realizing that they are in the presence of an expert in their respective field, the prospect feels compelled to defer to you, and allows you to ask as many questions as you deem necessary, without interruption. ([Location 1958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1958))
- The objective of marketing is to: 1 Research the marketplace to identify the best prospective buyers—prospects, for short—for a particular product. 2 Develop a cost-effective strategy that gets the company’s message in front of as many of these prospects as possible. 3 Embed the message with some sort of offer or hook or call to action that prompts as many of these prospects as possible to enter the company’s sales funnel. ([Location 1967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1967))
- Coordinate with the sales department to ensure a seamless handoff of the funnel, so prospects can be turned into customers. ([Location 1975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1975))
- In essence, this is what Straight Line prospecting is all about: sifting through prospects who enter your sales funnel to eliminate the ones who don’t qualify to buy your product—thereby ([Location 1986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1986))
- four buying archetypes. **The first archetype is called buyers in heat**. These are basically your best, most motivated buyers. These prospects want your product, need your product, can benefit from your product, ([Location 1989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1989))
- what separates them from the rest of the pack is that they’ve already made the decision to do something about it ([Location 1993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1993))
- **you’ll find that somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of the total prospects that enter your sales funnel will fall into this category**; the rest will be spread among the other three. ([Location 1997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1997))
- **The second buying archetype is called buyers in power. These are your second best group of buyers. The primary difference between the first two archetypes is that buyers in power aren’t consciously feeling any major pain from their unfilled need**, ([Location 1998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=1998))
- their lack of urgency makes them feel like they’re in a position of power, so they’re not going to pull the trigger until they’re done shopping around ([Location 2001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2001))
- **On average, somewhere between 30 and 40 percent of the total prospects that enter your sales funnel will end up falling into this category.** ([Location 2004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2004))
- The prospects from the remaining two buying archetypes need to be weeded out as quickly as possible, especially those who fall into the third archetype: The dreaded lookie-loos. ([Location 2007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2007))
- There are four telltale signs that will alert you to the fact that you’re having your time wasted by a lookie-loo: 1 They tend to ask lots of questions that they seem to already know the answers to. 2 They make it a point to kick the tires of whatever it is you’re selling, almost to the point of over-kicking them. 3 **They let out a large number of ooos and aahs and yups, to reinforce the sense that they’re genuinely interested.** 4 When asked about their finances, they either become boisterously overconfident or unnecessarily vague. ([Location 2021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2021))
- Now, this takes us to the fourth and final buying archetype, which I refer to as the mistakes, or “the people who were dragged there.” In essence, these are people who never belonged in your sales funnel in the first place. ([Location 2032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2032))
- **So, in summary, the three main goals of Straight Line prospecting are as follows: 1 Identify the lookie-loos and the mistakes and remove them from your sales funnel as quickly as possible. 2 Gather the necessary intelligence from the buyers in heat and the buyers in power, and then continue moving them down the Straight Line towards the close. 3 Begin the process of turning the buyers in power into buyers in heat by amplifying their pain.** ([Location 2036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2036))
### THE TEN RULES OF STRAIGHT LINE PROSPECTING
- 1 You’re sifting through the prospects in your sales funnel by asking them a series of strategically prepared questions. 2 You’re using these questions to not only gather intelligence but also to separate the buyers in heat and buyers in power from the lookie-loos and the mistakes. 3 **You’re continuing to gather intelligence from the buyers in heat and buyers in power, while eliminating the lookie-loos and mistakes from your sales funnel as quickly as possible. 4 You’re transitioning the buyers in heat and the buyers in power to the next step in the syntax, so they can continue their journey down the Straight Line.** ([Location 2050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2050))
- Rule #1: You are a sifter, not an alchemist. ([Location 2062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2062))
- what he’s not waiting for is for the water itself to turn into gold. That’s a job for an alchemist, not a prospector. ([Location 2066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2066))
- Water is water and gold is gold; they’re different elements that don’t magically convert into one another, any more than lookie-loos and mistakes convert into buyers in heat or buyers in power. ([Location 2068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2068))
- Rule #2: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Always ask for permission to ask questions.</mark> ([Location 2071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2071))
- “John, just a couple of quick questions, so I don’t waste your time.” ([Location 2078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2078))
- I want you to notice how I use the word “so” in the second half of each of the three examples. In this context, we refer to the word “so” as a justifier, because it justifies your need to ask the prospect questions, as opposed to doing it out of curiosity or nosiness. ([Location 2082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2082))
- Rule #3: **You must always use a script**. ([Location 2087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2087))
- Another major benefit of using a prospecting script is that since you already know what words you’re going to say, your conscious mind is freed up to focus on applying the right tonality to your words, ([Location 2092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2092))
- Rule #4: **Go from less invasive questions to more invasive questions.** ([Location 2096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2096))
- By way of definition, psychologists describe desensitization as a diminished emotional response to an adverse stimuli after repeated exposure to it. ([Location 2116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2116))
- Rule #5: **Ask each question using the right tonality**. ([Location 2122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2122))
- For now, what you need to understand is that each prospecting question will have its own “best” tonality, which maximizes the chance of your prospect giving you the most forthright answer, ([Location 2124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2124))
- Given that life insurance is a fear-based sale, it’s especially crucial that your intelligence-gathering effort not only uncovers his primary pain point but also amplifies it, as this will be the key to closing the sale. ([Location 2129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2129))
- if you had used the “I care” tonality, along with “I feel your pain,” then the extra words your prospect would have heard would have said, “Wow, this guy really cares about me; he really genuinely wants to know.” ([Location 2138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2138))
- if you attach the wrong tonality to your question, it will cause you to break rapport with your prospect ([Location 2140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2140))
- Rule #6: **Use the correct body language as the prospect responds.** ([Location 2144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2144))
- 1 Nodding your head while your prospect is speaking. This shows that you understand what they are saying and that you’re on the same page as them. 2 Narrowing your eyes and compressing your lips, while nodding your head slowly, when your prospect is disclosing an issue that’s very important to them. 3 Narrowing your eyes even more while compressing your lips more intensely, if the above topic deals with one of the prospect’s pain points. In addition, you’ll continue to nod your head slowly while letting out the appropriate oohs and aahs to show that you actually feel your prospect’s pain. 4 Leaning forward when you ask an emotionally charged question, and then continuing to lean forward while your prospect answers (while also using the active listening techniques I laid out above in number 3). 5 Leaning back when you ask a question that’s grounded in logic, and continue to lean back and nod your head in understanding and scratch your chin thoughtfully while your prospect answers. ([Location 2151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2151))
- Rule #7: **Always follow a logical path.** ([Location 2167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2167))
- Rule #8: **Make mental notes; don’t resolve their pain.** ([Location 2209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2209))
- **When you’re qualifying a prospect, all you should be doing is asking questions and making mental notes based on their responses. You do not want to try to resolve their pain at this point.** In fact, if anything, you want to amplify that pain. ([Location 2210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2210))
- In other words, when a prospect reveals their pain to you, you don’t want to jump the gun and say, “Oh great! There’s no need to worry now! My product is going to take away all your pain, so there’s no longer any reason to feel bad anymore. Just sit back and relax while I explain everything to you.” ([Location 2214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2214))
- Rule #9: **Always end with a powerful transition.** ([Location 2222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2222))
- **“Well, John, based on everything you just said to me, this program is definitely a perfect fit for you. Let me tell you why . . .” Or you could substitute the word “product” for “program”—or use the actual name of either one. **([Location 2237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2237))
- Rule #10: **Stay on the Straight Line; don’t go spiraling off to Pluto.** ([Location 2241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2241))
- “Now, again, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">genuine rapport is based on two things. “First, that you care—meaning, that you’re not just looking to make a commission; you want to help your prospect fill his needs and resolve his pain.</mark> Basically, you have his best interest at heart, as opposed to your own. “And, second, that you’re just like him—meaning that human beings want to associate with people who are just like them, versus the exact opposite of them. ([Location 2283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2283))
- **“The bottom line is this: We don’t associate with other people based on our differences; we associate based on our commonalities.** ([Location 2292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2292))
- “Then, after he’s finally done orbiting Pluto, all you need to say is something along the lines of ‘Wow, that’s totally cool. It sounds really interesting. I can see why you feel that way. Now as far as your goal for learning how to trade currencies goes . . .’ ([Location 2313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2313))
- “The key here is that you always remember that rapport is not a constant; it goes up and down throughout the sale, depending on the following two things: “One, how your prospect thinks and feels about the last point you made; and two, his belief as to whether or not you are on the same page with him, ([Location 2318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2318))
- “**So, if at any moment you sense that you’re falling out of rapport with your prospect, then you need to stop, regroup, and make a conscious effort to get back into rapport, using the active listening protocol I laid out for you, along with two specific tonalities I went through this morning—‘I care (I really want to know)’ and ‘I feel your pain.’** ([Location 2326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2326))

- **The second component of charisma is the targeted use of body language** ([Location 2359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2359))
- **heavy emphasis on active listening**, ([Location 2360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2360))
- And charisma’s third component—which is typically the toughest one of all, for most people—is not saying stupid shit. ([Location 2361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2361))
- In other words, imagine taking the ten best sales presentations that you’ve ever made for a particular product and going through each one of them line by line, with an eye on choosing the best passages from each and then combining them into one, ([Location 2379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2379))
- It’s basically all of your best sales lines, arranged in exactly the right order—starting ([Location 2382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2382))
- In short, the philosophy of strategic preparation is based on anticipating everything that might possibly come up in a sale and having the best possible response to it prepared in advance. ([Location 2486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2486))
- So let’s start by going through the eight things that set Straight Line scripts apart from everything else out there. ([Location 2488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2488))
- **First, your script must not be front-loaded.** ([Location 2490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2490))
- **Front-loading is when you disclose all your major benefits right up front**, ([Location 2491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2491))
- **The key to writing a great script is to frame, not front-load.** ([Location 2494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2494))
- In other words, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the way you raise someone’s level of certainty is bit by bit; you can’t do it all at once.</mark> ([Location 2499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2499))
- **Second, focus on the benefits, not the features.** ([Location 2500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2500))
- While there’s no denying that this is Sales 101, for some inexplicable reason, the average salesperson tends to gravitate towards focusing on a product’s features, not its benefits. ([Location 2501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2501))
- **Third, your script must have stopping-off points.** ([Location 2507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2507))
- **after you make a powerful statement, you want to lock it down by asking the prospect a simple yes-or-no question, such as: “You follow me so far?” or “Make sense?” or “Are you with me?”** ([Location 2511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2511))
- these little stopping-off points serve as periodic rapport checks. For example, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">if you say to your prospect “Make sense so far?” and they reply “Yes,” then you’re in rapport; however, if they reply, “No,” then you’re out of rapport, and you can’t move forward in the script until you’ve gotten to the bottom of things.</mark> ([Location 2513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2513))
- So, instead of moving forward, you’re going to loop back and give your prospect a little more information that relates to that topic, and then ask them again if things make sense so far. ([Location 2517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2517))
- Fourth, write in the spoken word, not grammatically correct English. ([Location 2519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2519))
- Fifth, your script must flow perfectly. ([Location 2528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2528))
- Sixth, your scripts must be honest and ethical. ([Location 2537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2537))
- I’m the first one to admit that I wrote some scripts back in the early days that I’m not particularly proud of. It’s not that they were full of lies, but there were some serious omissions of fact, ([Location 2540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2540))
- **Seventh, remember the overarching equation of energy in, benefits out.** ([Location 2556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2556))
- The name of this equation is energy in, benefits out, and it comes into play each time you ask for the order—including when you respond to buy signals during the back half of the sale. ([Location 2563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2563))
- instructing their inner monologue to pose a simple, yet very pointed question, namely: At the end of the day, is it really worth it? ([Location 2565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2565))
- **By the way, never forget that money is basically nothing more than stored energy. In essence, you expend energy by engaging in some type of work, for which you receive money in return.** ([Location 2583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2583))
- “Now, John, getting started here is very, very simple. It’s just a question of your name, some basic information, and then we handle everything else for you over on this end. And when you combine that with [benefit #1] and [benefit #2] and [benefit #3], then, believe me, John, the only problem you’re going to have is that you didn’t buy more. Sound fair enough?” ([Location 2596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2596))
- That’s a very low energy in, massive benefits out close, and it can be easily adapted to any industry. ([Location 2599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2599))
- **Let’s say you’ve already asked for the order for the first time and you’re in the middle of running a looping pattern, and your prospect suddenly asks, “What was the price on that again?” To which you reply, “Oh, it’s only three thousand dollars,” and you say no more. Alas, you just committed sales hara-kiri. Why? Simply put, you’ve just created a scenario where there’s $3,000 worth of energy going in and zero benefits coming out**, ([Location 2608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2608))
- And eighth, a Straight Line script is part of a series of scripts. ([Location 2626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2626))
- In fact, **there might be as many as five or six different scripts that take you through from the open to the close. For example, you’ll have a script that starts with those all-important first four seconds, and then includes your qualifying questions and your transition. Second, you’ll have a script that starts with the main body of your presentation and ends with you asking for the order** ([Location 2627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2627))
- Third, you’ll have a series of rebuttal scripts that include the well-thought-out answers you’ve prepared to the various common objections you’re going to hear. And fourth, you’ll have a series of looping scripts that will include the various language patterns that will allow you to loop back into the sale, ([Location 2630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2630))
- The most important thing to remember throughout this entire process is that until a definitive agreement gets signed and money changes hands, the deal is not closed, which means you need to keep in touch with the prospect and do whatever you can to keep the Three Tens at the highest level possible. ([Location 2669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2669))
- The Power of Language Patterns ([Location 2696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2696))
- in terms of the order in which you go about creating certainty, you’re always going to follow the same protocol, which is:  The product first  You, the salesperson second  And the company that stands behind the product third ([Location 2702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2702))
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In terms of the split between logic and emotion, you’re always going to build airtight logical cases first and airtight emotional cases second.</mark> ([Location 2705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2705))
- In short, there is a pattern for everything. In the front half of the sale, your language patterns serve as anchors for each step of the syntax, and they’re an important aspect of ensuring a successful outcome. ([Location 2713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2713))
- **Here are the basic rules for creating a powerful introduction. We’ll assume an outbound phone call:  Be enthusiastic right from the start.  Always speak in the familiar. For example, you wouldn’t say, “Hi, is Mr. Jones there?” You would say, “Hi, is John there?”  Introduce yourself and your company in the first couple of sentences, and then restate the name of your company a second time within the first couple of sentences.  Use power words, like “dramatically,” “explosive,” “fastest growing,” “most well respected.” Power words go a very long way to capturing someone’s attention and establishing yourself as an expert.  Use your justifiers (I went through these in Chapter 10).  Ask for permission to begin the qualification process.** ([Location 2718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2718))
- **Here are some sample big picture questions that can be used in virtually any industry:** ([Location 2731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2731))
- **What do you like or dislike about your current supplier?** ([Location 2732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2732))
- **What is your biggest headache with your business?** ([Location 2735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2735))
- **What would be your ideal program if you could design it?** ([Location 2743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2743))
- Of all the factors that we have just spoken about, what is the most important to you? ([Location 2745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2745))
- When you introduce yourself, remember to speak in the familiar and to always sound upbeat and enthusiastic. 2 The next pattern is going to be to get their response of “I’m okay.” “If you recall, we met last Thursday night at the Marriott,” or “If you recall, you sent in a postcard a few weeks back,” or “We’ve been reaching out to people in your area . . .” In short, you are trying to link up this call with the time you first met your prospect, or when they took an action, like filling out a postcard or clicking on a website. 3 **This next pattern is extremely important and is the reason for the call, your justifier. In essence, your justifier creates a valid reason to be calling today, and it will dramatically increase your compliance rate. 4 From here you get into the qualifying portion of your script, and you start by asking for permission to ask questions.** This is another example of using a justifier, this time with the word “so.” “Just a couple of quick questions so I don’t waste your time.” This gives a reason why you need to ask the prospect questions, and that reason is so you don’t waste their time. You always want to ask for permission to qualify. 5 The last part of your open is always a transition. “Based on everything you said to me, this is a perfect fit for you.” This should be an anchor for you; you should know it by heart. ([Location 2752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2752))
- **I make each salesperson create three or four language patterns for each of the Three Tens, and then I pool them all together and pick the best of the patterns to create one master script.** ([Location 2768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2768))
- To that end, let me give you a head start by providing you with a handful of powerful tips and guidelines for creating language patterns for the body and the close. ([Location 2771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2771))
    - Note: Go to book location
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Remember, 10 percent of human communication is words; the other 90 percent is tonality and body language. By memorizing my script, I free up my conscious mind to focus on the 90 percent.</mark> ([Location 2816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2816))
### THE ART AND SCIENCE OF LOOPING
## New highlights added January 21, 2024 at 8:04 AM
- the only prospects you should be presenting to at this point are those whose answers to your intelligence-gathering questions dictated that they not only were interested in your product but also needed your product and could afford your product. ([Location 2836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2836))
- you shouldn’t expect to get hit with a flat-out no more than 1 or 2 percent of the time, ([Location 2840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2840))
#### The Art of Deflection
- Specifically, the reengagement process consists of you leading your prospect, Bill Peterson, through the following steps: ([Location 2860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2860))
    - Note: Go to location
- from your very first word, your tonality must be positive and upbeat, with a hint of bottled enthusiasm slipping out around the edges. ([Location 2863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2863))
- The way to avoid this is to simply ask him if the conversation “rings a bell,” to which he will almost always reply with a yes. ([Location 2868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2868))
- You: Hi, is Bill there? Your Prospect: Yeah, this is Bill. You: Hey, Bill! It’s John Smith, calling from XYZ Securities, on Wall Street. How you doing today? Your Prospect: I’m okay. You: Okay, great! Now, Bill, if you recall, we spoke a few weeks back, and I emailed you a bit of information on my company, XYZ Securities, along with some links to a few of our recent stock recommendations. Does that ring a bell? Your Prospect: Uh, yeah, I think so. You: Okay, great! Now, Bill, the last time we spoke, I promised to get back to you when I came across an investment idea that had huge upside potential with very little downside risk. Well, the reason for the call today is that something just came across my desk, and it’s perhaps the best thing I’ve seen in the last six months. If you have sixty seconds, I’d like to share the idea with you. You got a minute? ([Location 2882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2882))
- you’ll close out the front half of the sale by directly asking for the order for the first time, in no uncertain terms—meaning, there’s no beating around the bush ([Location 2894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2894))
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">For example, let’s say Bill replies, “It sounds interesting. Let me think about it.” To that, you’ll answer with the standard Straight Line response to an initial objection, which is: “I hear what you’re saying, Bill, but let me ask you a question: Does the idea make sense to you? Do you like the idea?”</mark> ([Location 2910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2910))
- Now, notice how, rather than directly answering his objection, you deflected it instead. ([Location 2920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2920))
- Specifically, **you acknowledged the fact that you heard what Bill said to you—to ensure that he didn’t feel ignored, which would cause a break in rapport**—and ([Location 2920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2920))
- So, that being said, given the fact that I pegged Bill’s response at a 6 on the certainty scale, does it make sense for you to move forward on the Straight Line towards the close? The answer is no, absolutely not. ([Location 2957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2957))
- **A 6 is not nearly high enough on the certainty scale** ([Location 2959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2959))
- **So, rather than moving forward and trying to close the deal, you’re going to loop back to the front half of the sale instead**—to the point on the Straight Line when you had just finished delivering the main body of your Straight Line sales presentation—and make a follow-up presentation that builds on the airtight logical case that you framed during your initial presentation. ([Location 2963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2963))
- “Exactly—it really is a great buy down here! In fact, one of the true beauties here is . . .” and then you’ll go directly into the main body of your follow-up presentation. ([Location 2973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2973))
- **The one exception to this is if your prospect’s response is below a 3 on the certainty scale. In that case, you’re going to end the encounter right then and there and move on to the next prospect.** ([Location 2993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=2993))
- With human beings, the first number you need to crack is the first Ten; and in order to consider it cracked, you need to hear an enthusiastic yes from your prospect that measures at least an 8 on the certainty scale, ([Location 3018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3018))
- **You see, while Bill’s original objection was “Let me think about it,” rather than acting like every other salesperson and asking him the dead-end question “So, tell me, Bill, precisely what do you need to think about?” you took control of the sale and started picking the lock on his buying strategy.** ([Location 3086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3086))
- **Case in point: his real objection is that he doesn’t know you, and therefore has no basis for trusting you**; ([Location 3090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3090))
- But, again, that’s how human beings are built, especially in a sales setting. When that trust pendulum starts to swing, it swings all the way. ([Location 3120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3120))
- when Bill admitted that it was actually a lack of trust that’s holding him back, not his original objection. ([Location 3123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3123))
- **“Now, that I can understand. You don’t know me, and I don’t have the luxury of a track record; so let me take a moment to reintroduce myself.** ([Location 3126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3126))
- Now, for the vast majority of salespeople, getting hit with even one objection is enough to send the sale plunging into a death spiral. However, when they get hit with a second objection—which, like the first one, is nothing more than a smoke screen for uncertainty—that’s when things start to get comical. ([Location 3174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3174))
- Let’s say that Bill didn’t buy after your first loop. Instead, when you asked for the order the second time, he said, “It sounds really good. Why don’t you give me your phone number, and I’ll call you back in a few days and let you know.” Your actual rebuttal to that objection would sound something like this: “I hear what you’re saying, Bill, but let me just say that I’ve been doing this for quite some time now, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s that when people say they’re going to think about it, or call you back, what ends up happening is that they end up putting the idea in the back of their mind and deciding against it, not because they don’t like the idea—in fact, in your case I know that you actually do—but the simple fact is that we’re both very busy people, and you’ll go back to your busy life and end up missing out on this; and I don’t want to see that happen to you. ([Location 3202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3202))
- In other words, the instant before you make a buying decision, your brain runs not one but two separate movies: it runs a positive one, which represents the upside potential, in the form of all the wonderful benefits that you’ll get to experience in the future if the product turns out to be as awesome as the salesman has cracked it up to be; and it runs a negative one, which represents the downside risk, ([Location 3245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3245))
- when it comes to considering the upside potential . . . well . . . in that case, I’ll really let my imagination go. I’ll be saying to myself, “Well, if this thing can help me get rid of those dastardly shanks I’ve been hitting and help me hit a beautiful drive like that skinny little Asian kid, then I can only imagine how great I’m going to feel ([Location 3256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3256))
- Instead, they keep hopping from objection to objection, saying things like: “Let me think about it” or “Let me call you back” or “Send me some information,” and so on. So, what do you do in those cases? The answer is, you lower your prospect’s action threshold, right on the spot. ([Location 3273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3273))
- In total, there are four ways to do this. The first way is to offer your prospect a money-back guarantee. ([Location 3275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3275))
- The second way is to offer your prospect a cooling off or rescission period. ([Location 3279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3279))
- The third way is to use certain key phrases that paint a picture that runs counter to the worries and concerns ([Location 3283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3283))
- The way you go about reversing these movies is by using the aforementioned language pattern to rewrite their respective scripts along the lines of a low-action-threshold individual. ([Location 3292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3292))
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">People who are feeling significant pain tend to act quickly; conversely, people who are in denial of their pain tend to act slowly.</mark> ([Location 3330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3330))
- **This is why you introduce pain in two spots: first, during the intelligence-gathering phase, you want to identify where your prospect’s pain lies and, if necessary, amplify it to ensure that your prospect listens to your presentation from that perspective; and second, you’re going to reintroduce that pain right now, at the beginning of your third loop, using a language pattern that sounds something like this:** ([Location 3347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3347))
- In fact, as soon as you sense that your prospect is feeling even the slightest bit pressured, you immediately want to pull back and say something along the lines of: “Jim, please don’t misconstrue my enthusiasm for pressure; it’s just that I know that this truly is a perfect fit for you . . . ,” ([Location 3373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MG7ETBM&location=3373))
